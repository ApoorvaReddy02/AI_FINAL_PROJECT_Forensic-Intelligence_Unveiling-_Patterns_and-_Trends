# AI_FINAL_PROJECT_Forensic-Intelligence_Unveiling-_Patterns_and-_Trends
Build machine learning models capable of accurately predicting criminal activity based on diverse features such as location, time, and demographics.
# Overview of Crime Analysis using Random forest Algorithm
Here, we will use the Random Forest Algorithm to forecast various crime categories.Initially, Numpy and Pandas serve as tools for data collection and preprocessing.The data was split into training and testing sets.We develop a random forest model, which we then assess using metrics like F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall.
# Random Forest Algorithm
A machine learning approach called random forest is applied to regression and classification problems. To provide a final output, it builds numerous decision trees and then combines their predictions. Random forests can be used in crime analysis to forecast the probability of criminal action based on a variety of characteristics, including location, time, and demographics.
The random forest technique is renowned for its capacity to manage huge datasets with noisy characteristics and a high dimensionality. Its use of random selections of the data and characteristics also makes it less prone to overfitting than other decision tree-based techniques.
# Instructions to run the Project
Anaconda Navigator must be installed before you can execute the code.Later on, you will need to launch a Jupyter notebook and import the test.csv and train.csv files as well as the necessary libraries, such as Numpy, pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. By utilizing libraries, you can preprocess the data by removing unnecessary libraries, choosing features, and obtaining prediction values through the random forest algorithm.Recall and F1 scores were also computed.This project is finally saved in an rfc_predict.csv file (which we attempted to publish here since github doesn't accept files larger than 100 MB)

Note
Git LFS is a paid feature on GitHub, and there are usage limits for free accounts. If you need to upload a large number of files or files larger than the allowed limit, you may need to upgrade to a paid plan.
